# TAQ

TAQ is one of Parity's historical market data file formats. It consists of the
best bids and offers (BBOs) and trades.

## Architecture

TAQ uses the tab-separated values (TSV) file format with ASCII encoding.

A TAQ file consists of a header and zero or more records. The header and each
record consist of a fixed number of fields. One field, Record Type, specifies
which fields are present in a record. Fields that are not present in a record
are empty.

## Data Types

Dates are represented as `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601).

Timestamps are represented as `HH:MM:SS.SSS` (ISO 8601).

Prices and sizes are represented either as integers or as decimal numbers
using decimal point.
