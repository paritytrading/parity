# POE

POE is Parity's native order entry protocol. With it market participants can
enter orders, cancel them and receive status updates on them.

## Architecture

POE consists of logical messages passed between a client application and a
trading system. Each message type has a fixed message length.

Messages from the trading system to the client application are sequenced. In
case of a network disconnection, the client application can request messages
starting from the last known sequence number.

Messages from the client application to the trading system can be resent
benignly. In case of a network disconnection, the client application can
resend messages to which it has not yet received acknowledgements.

POE uses NASDAQ SoupBinTCP 3.00 as the underlying transport protocol. The
protocol provides authentication and keep-alive as well as the aforementioned
message sequencing mechanism.

## Data Types

Number fields are encoded as unsigned integers in network byte order.

Text fields are encoded as ASCII, left-justified and padded on the right with
the space character.

Prices are represented in terms of the minimum price increment.

Quantities are represented in tems of the minimum quantity increment.

Timestamps are represented as nanoseconds since the midnight of the day on
which the trading session started.

## Inbound Messages

Inbound messages are sent by the client application to the trading system.
